# check_in

1. Sometimes I get confused with the gitignore when I try to make a commit and push to github things git carazy.

2. I need to get better with the setup and management of files. ex images

3. Need practise with web page layout, moving div containers around. also how to label elements in the html page to style with `CSS`
